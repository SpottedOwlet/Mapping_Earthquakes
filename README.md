<h2> <p align=center>Mapping_Earthquakes </p></h2>

<h3> Background & Purpose: </h3>

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. Along with this, the tectonic plates data was added as a layer to the original map layer as an overlay object. Another layer for just viewing the major earthquakes data was created and passed to the map layer as another overlay object. The data for all earthquakes, tectonic plates and only major earthquakes can be seen in three different tile layers as per viewer's choice.
